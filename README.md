### Web-scrape of The Walking Dead IMDB user ratings

The Walking Dead is my favorite ever T.V show and I'm that sad I rate all of the episodes on IMDB. I have recently had to brush the dust off some old notes on web-scraping in R using rvest for a work related project. It then crossed my mind why not have some fun with it, web-scrape the IMDB scores and visualise them to see how the show has progressed in the eyes of many. I find it entertaining and I practice some R so it was a win-win. It is a bonus that I can brush up my rvest knowledge and skills and create a project from it!

The web-scrape is contained within an Rmd file so I can more effectivly comment the process and describe outptus for further ciruclation. I go through the scrape and data wrangling process and then visualise the user-rating history using ggplot for fun.
